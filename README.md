# Trustpilot-API-Customer-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, we fetch customer reviews from the Trustpilot API and perform sentiment analysis using OpenAI's GPT-4. The steps include fetching reviews, cleaning and preprocessing the data, analyzing sentiment, and visualizing the results. Finally, the processed data is stored in an Azure SQL Database for further analysis and reporting.
